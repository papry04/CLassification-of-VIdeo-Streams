# CLassification-of-VIdeo-Streams
CLassification of VIdeo Streams based on various deep learning and ML approaches 
 Network packet classification is a critical process in modern net
work security and management systems, enabling tasks such as
 intrusion detection, quality of service (QoS) enforcement, and traffic
 monitoring. With the advent of modern video streaming applica
tions, network traffic patterns have become increasingly complex,
 requiring robust methods for efficient classification and manage
ment. This study explores various approaches to classifying net
work packets using machine learning techniques and deep packet
 inspection based deep learning approaches. By leveraging statisti
cal features of packet headers and payloads, the proposed method
 demonstrates high accuracy in distinguishing between various
 video streaming applications. Additionally, it incorporates real
time processing capabilities to ensure minimal impact on network
 performance. Experimental evaluations on 5G traffic dataset [3]
 showthat our approach outperforms traditional rule-based systems
 and achieves state-of-the-art results in accuracy, precision, and
 recall. The findings underscore the potential of advanced classifi
cation techniques in enhancing network security and efficiency.
 These findings underscore the potential of advanced machine learn
ing techniques in revolutionizing network traffic management and
 security infrastructure.
